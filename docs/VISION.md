# Vision Statement
---

Our vision is to become Canada's premier flight-booking platform, where travellers can seamlessly discover and book the most tailored flight options, redefining their travel experience. We will create a unique travel experience for every customer by providing an easy and efficient way to manage personal data, real-time flight information, and a comprehensive solution for booking, check-in, and secure payments before and after the flights.

Skylink is primarily designed to be used by both frequent and occasional travelers. It will provide every traveler the opportunity to plan their trip by exploring multiple flights and selecting the most suitable ones based on their preferences and requirements. Our platform will allow users to choose and reserve their preferred seats during the booking process for their ease and comfort. We will provide travelers the freedom to explore various filtering options such as date suggestions, one-way or round-trip booking, and price-wise sorting to prioritize their convenience. 

Our platform provides a straightforward and secure way to manage payments, allowing easy access for account creation, flight plan adjustments, and seamless information updates. With user-friendly navigation, members can effortlessly log in, register, and engage with our services. Skylink streamlines the journey with an online check-in system, allowing passengers to bypass queues at the airline counter. This system includes a component to generate boarding passes, ensuring a smooth transition from check-in to boarding gates. Enhancing the travel experience further, Skylink keeps travelers informed with a real-time notification system, from booking confirmation to arrival. Passengers can also tailor their journey with various pre-departure options, including in-flight meals, lounge access, priority boarding, and entertainment packages.

The value of Skylink lies in its commitment to making air travel accessible, stress-free, and rewarding for all users. By offering a simplified and intuitive interface, users can effortlessly log in, manage their profiles, search for flights, book their journeys, and complete secure payments, all within a single system. The inclusion of a reminder system provides the quickest and most real-time updates that agents might not deliver on time. By utilizing our user-friendly check-in and boarding pass program, users can save valuable time before the trip. Skylink also enhances user experience by providing innovative seat booking and various add-ons to construct a personalized and memorable trip.

The project will be considered successful based on four criteria. Firstly, we aim to win the userâ€™s heart and this will be evident by becoming the top travel app on Google Play Store and reaching one million downloads in our first year.  Also, we want to make sure that fewer than 10% of users stop using the app in the first year. Thirdly, a critical achievement is to meet a 90% success rate in providing users with real-time flight updates and notifications for any changes to their booked flights. Lastly, our goal is to attract approximately 40% of Canadian travelers using our system to fulfill their travel needs and ensure their satisfaction.
