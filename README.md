Canada's premier flight-booking platform, where travelers can seamlessly discover and book the most innovative and tailored flight options, redefining their travel experience.

The purpose of developing an airline reservation system - Skyline, is to streamline and enhance the process of booking domestic flights within Canada. By utilizing current technology and intuitive design, the application offers various features aimed at optimizing the user experience from flight search to post-booking management.

Users are empowered to efficiently manage their bookings and profiles through a secure login and signup system.The application provides seamless flight searches to and from Canadian airports and presents search results in a clear and organized manner, showcasing both direct and indirect flight options, as well as distinguishing between economy and business class accommodations.

To enhance user experience, the application provides various flight sorting options such as lowest price, direct flight availability, and earliest departing flights. Moreover, users have the flexibility to select preferred seat for each passenger prior to proceeding to the payment stage. We also provide the ability to add extras such as extra baggage, pet accommodations, Wi-Fi services, or wheelchair assistance, to meet individual needs. To emphasize reliablity, the application provides an easy and secure payment system. Finally, users have access to a comprehensive overview of their confirmed flights, facilitating easy reference and management of travel arrangements.

In summary, Skylink provides a user-centric solution to simplify and enhance the flight booking experience for domestic travel within Canada.
